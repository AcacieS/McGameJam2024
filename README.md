### Description

This game is set in the McGill university where researchers test a BCI system. The first few levels are used to train the player to use the BCI system. Then after, an error occurs and the tester enters into the entire computer (not only contained by the testing program). The brain of the tester receives raw input from the computer and interprets it differently. We didn't have enough time to implement all the textures. However, the game is still playable and looks good.

The last level has some light flickering issues. We are not too sure what is the cause of this.

This game contains Voice-Overs generated by Eleven Labs. Although it is pre-generated.

This game features a Minimax AI for the Chess Game at the last level. The implemented algorithm is somewhat faulty as the AI will not always make the best move.

The gravity is slightly broken. The player jumps too high.
